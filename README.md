Configuration for headphones Hifiman HE400i model 2017

# Prerequisites / configuration / installation

* you need to configure your **soundcard to 7.1 surround channels speakers**. If your card doesn't support this setup, you will need to use a virtual audio card allowing 7.1 surround channels speakers, for example Voice Meter Banana, and route the audio signals to your physical soundcard (in stereo or anything else).
* you need to configure the **sampling rate to 48khz**. If not, DSP will not work correctly and you will get a huge boost in audio level, so make sure to put sound at minimum level the first time.
* you need to install EqualizerAPO and extract the files into the folder `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO`

After setup, you should see something similar to this in the analyzer panel of EqualizerAPO:
